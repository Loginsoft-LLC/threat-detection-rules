# Threat Detection Rules
Threat Detection &amp; Anomaly Detection rules for popular open-source components. And some of the rules are of emerging threats which we observed in wild.
Most of the rules were developed in Sigma format, you can find more information & community contributed rules [here](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma)


This project is one of the projects that our Loginsoft Research & Innovation Unit is working on constantly to help organizations & contributing to the community. Our research is still in the experimental phase, the rules provided can be altered as per your need. 

To learn how to use our rules on Anomaly Detection, have a look at our [Documentation](http://loginsoftsecurity.gitbook.io/threat-detection)
